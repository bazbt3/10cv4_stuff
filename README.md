## What is 10Cv4?

[**https://10centuries.org/**](https://10centuries.org/) is a web social and publishing platform with an interesting concept; the user owns the data, the service has the lofty goal of preserving said data for 10 centuries.  It's not my job to sell stuff, the service speaks for itself.
