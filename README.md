Stuff related to Jason Irwin's 10centuries.org social platform.

## What is 10Cv4?

[**https://10centuries.org/**](https://10centuries.org/) is a web social and publishing platform with an interesting concept; the user owns the data, the service has the lofty goal of preserving said data for 10 centuries.  It's not my job to sell stuff, the service speaks for itself.

There's a site blog, the earliest post is perhaps the best place to start: [https://blog.10centuries.org/2016/01/26/happy-new-year](https://blog.10centuries.org/2016/01/26/happy-new-year)

## My preview observations:

A chronological list of issues I found as I settled in post- Jason Urwin's invite.  It would perhaps have been better to have GitHub Issues setup, but I created [**a Markdown file instead.**](preview_observations.md)
